=head3 Initializing it for a clean machine

B<NOTE:>This is considered harmful and should only be done if you B<know> what you are doing!

Usually when I setup a new box I don't really care about the old config. I just remove it.

 for i in $(ls /path/to/dotfiles/)
 do 
     if [ -x ~/.$i ]
     then
         rm .$i
     fi
     ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/$i ~/.$i
 done
