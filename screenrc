# ESCAPE - the COMMAND CHARACTER
# ===============================================================
escape ^aa  # default
# escape ^pp  # suggested binding for emacs users


# PASSWORD
# ===============================================================
# This commands sets the *internal* password for the screen session.
# WARNING!! If this is set then a "lock" command will only let you in to the
# session after you enter the user's account password and then *also*
# the internal password for that session. This gives additional safety but,
# if you forget the internal password then you cannot resume your session.
# Use :password to generate a password
# password ODSJQf.4IJN7E    # "1234"


# VARIABLES
# ===============================================================
# No annoying audible bell, using "visual bell"
vbell on                                # default: off
vbell_msg "   -- Bell,Bell!! --   "     # default: "Wuff,Wuff!!"
#  bell  "%C -> %n%f %t bell!~"

# activity              'Activity in window %n' # default
#


# There are two kinds of messages:  "activity" and "bell"
# They are also the names of the commands that set the
# respective messages.  In every message there can be "meta
# strings" which are replaced by values.  A meta string starts
# with a percent sign and is then followed by one
# of the following letters: aAcCdDfFhHlmMnstuwWyY
# The meta strings usually refer to the current
# date and time or to a window title or number.
# There are also some specials like embedded branches (with %?),
# color codes (with %{xy}) and padding (with %=, %<, %>).
# you can find their description in the manual in section
# "STRING ESCAPES":
#  %%      percent sign (the escape character itself)
#  %a      either 'am' or 'pm' - according to the current time
#  %A      either 'AM' or 'PM' - according to the current time
#  %c      current time HH:MM in 24h format
#  %C      current time HH:MM in 12h format
#  %d      day number - number of current day
#  %D      Day's name - the weekday name of the current day
#  %f      flags of the window
#  %F      sets %? to true if the window has the focus
#  %h      hardstatus of the window
#  %H      hostname of the system
#  %l      current load of the system
#  %m      month number
#  %M      month name
#  %n      window number
#  %s      seconds
#  %t      window title
#  %u      all other users on this window
#  %w      all window numbers and names.
#  %-w     all window numbers up to the current window
#  %+w     all window numbers after the current window
#  %W      all window numbers and names except the current one
#  %y      last two digits of the year number
#  %Y      full year number
#
# Older versions of screen used a single '%' character
# to display window titles - but since version 3.7 this is
# obsoleted by '%n' and it will vanish in future releases.
# So please update your screenrc to meet this convention!

# KEYBINDINGS
# ==============================================================
# The "bind" command assign keys to (internal) commands
# SCREEN checks all the keys you type; you type the key
# which is known as the "command character" then SCREEN
# eats this key, too, and checks whether this key is
# "bound" to a command.  If so then SCREEN will execute it.
#
# The command "bind" allows you to chose which keys
# will be assigned to the commands.
#
# Some commands are bound to several keys -
# usually to both some letter and its corresponding
# control key combination, eg the command
# "(create) screen" is bound to both 'c' and '^C'.
#
# The following list shows the default bindings:
#
# break       ^B b
# clear       C
# colon       :
# copy        ^[ [
# detach      ^D d
# digraph     ^V
# displays    *
# dumptermcap .
# fit         F
# flow        ^F f
